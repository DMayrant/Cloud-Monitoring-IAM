# IAM with MFA
This project focuses on the importance of using IAM, MFA and Cloudtrail to help to ensure cloud environment safety from thret actors

This repository gives an example of how to use IAM with MFA, andCloudtrail logs to monitor for suspicious activity in your cloud infrastructure from threat actors by preventing access to sensitive information within your companyâ€™s databases. Using Cloud Trail logs will help companies monitor and provision all API calls within their cloud environment. Cloud trail logs can be sent to splunk for log analysis or to S3 for simple storage, an employee can be notified about changes within their account via simple notification service SNS or simple email service SES. The average cost of a cyber attack is about $5 million, damaging the reputation, customer trust, and increased overhead cost to fund security incidence response. Insuring the principle of least-privilege, zero-trust and IAM will help reduce risk.
